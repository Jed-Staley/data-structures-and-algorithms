# Fizz Buzz

Write a function that takes in a k-nary tree as an argument and returns the same tree but for each node:
If the value is divisible by 3, change it to 'Fizz'
If the value is divisible by 5, change it to 'Buzz'
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, change it to 'FizzBuzz'
If the value is divisible by neither 3 nor 5, change it to a string
